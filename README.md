# SpendWisely-Server

The project consists of a website targeting college students as its users. It's a web application that allows users to track their expenses, to manage and save money. Users can input their income and expenses along with the corresponding category for the transaction. The user will have access to reports and other diagrams which will indicate if the income was higher than the expenses or the other way around. The website will provide a detailed report of how much money was spent on each of the categories.
